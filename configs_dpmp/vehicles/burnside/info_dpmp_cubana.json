"Description":"Specials are very loved in Cuba because of their durability and comfort, These cars suffer during their long life and are fixed with random spare parts, they have at least 1 million miles but they run like a swiss clock!, this Special is fitted with a 1.6 Liter Engine because it's much more economical to maintain than an old American V8",
