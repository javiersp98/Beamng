"Description":"Tuner T.R.C. is known for their extreme modifications to street vehicles, turning anything into a beastly racing car. The Roamer was no exception, and T.R.C. pushed it to the limits, lowering the suspension, equipping drag tires, removing excess weight, putting in a high performance radiator, and adding a massive supercharger to the 4.5L V8. The T.R.C. Roamer is the family carrying supercar you didn't know you wanted.",
