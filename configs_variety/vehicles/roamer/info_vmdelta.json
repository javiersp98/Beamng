"Description":"One of the least known Roamer variants was the 'Delta' model, intended for extreme off-roading and anything thrown at it. A heavy duty dually rear axle with off-road suspension was fitted, a bull bar was welded to the frame, unnecessary parts were removed, the roof rack came fully equipped, and the 4.5L V8 engine was supercharged. Unpopular with both buyers and critics, the 'Delta' was soon pulled from production.",
