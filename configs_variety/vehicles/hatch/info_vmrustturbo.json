"Description":"Left for a number of years in a forest on the East Coast, this rare Turbo model still has some life left in it. The years haven't been kind, rust has grabbed hold of the car, the clear coat is gone, and the tires attached to the blow suspension are cracked and dry rotted. Missing are the original wheels, as well as the Okudai back bumper, but equipped with a roll cage, and with an overhaul, this Covet Turbo could be an excellent track car once again.",
