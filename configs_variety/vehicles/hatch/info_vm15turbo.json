"Description":"Built as a 'racing car for the streets,' the Turbo Limited was quite powerful for such a small car. Ibishu's 1.5L DOHC I4 was given some extra power with a stage one turbocharger, and GT exhaust, Odukai bumpers and sideskirts gave better aerodynamics along with the spoiler, and the sport tuned suspension with Okudai RZ4 wheels kept the car in the driver's control. The exact number of Turbo Limited Covets built is unknown, although it is known that all built came only with manual transmissions.",
