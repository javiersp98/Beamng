"Description":"The naturally aspirated Ibishu i-TEC AWD Sport was hugely popular when offered as a trim option for the Pessima. The high revving 2.1L I4 with sport intake provided 225 horsepower without a turbocharger, and came with special i-TEC exclusive all-white headlights, i-TEC Sport factory graphics, a spoiler, and gold 17'' Ibishu TWE wheels. These days, the i-TEC AWD Sport Pessima's are highly sought after by younger car buyers wanting a high power, well handling 90's Japanese import.",
