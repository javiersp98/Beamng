"Description":"The success of the Pessima as a rally car helped boost sales of the Pessima, and inspired Ibishu to release this limited edition model. The Pessima R was a rally ready street car, equipped with Ibishu TWE wheels, rally tuned suspension, raised ride height, AWD, rally lights, mudflaps, a turbocharged 2.0L I4, and a high performance radiator. The Pessima R was only offered with a manual transmission, keeping with rally standards. Ibishu advertised the car as a rally ready street car, claiming only a roll cage and a skidplate were needed to make it a qualified rally car. Only 1,000 units of the Pessima R were produced.",
