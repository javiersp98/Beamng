"Description":"The naturally aspirated Ibishu i-TEC was hugely popular when offered as a trim option for the Pessima. The high revving 2.1L I4 provided 200 horsepower without a turbocharger, and came with special i-TEC exclusive all-white headlights, i-TEC factory graphics, and silver 16'' Ibishu TWE wheels. These days, the i-TEC Pessima's are highly sought after by younger car buyers wanting a high power 90's Japanese import.",
