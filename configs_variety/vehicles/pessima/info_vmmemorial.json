"Description":"Shortly before the end of the Mk1 Pessima's production, famous rally driver Marco Rivel was killed in a fatal rally crash. Rivel's rally car of choice was well known to be the Ibishu Pessima, and soon after the crash, Ibishu announced a limited run memorial edition. The last 500 Mk1 Pessimas were made into the Rivel Memorial Edition, tuned specially by the Ibishu Racing Division with a powerful turbocharger, a higher performance radiator, sport suspension tuned to be more like rally suspension, and Okudai TWE rally wheels. The vehicle was released only in white with a red interior, red and grey decals, body colored trim, and a memorial edition badge.",
