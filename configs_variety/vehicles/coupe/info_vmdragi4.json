"Description":"Built by Ibishu, and completely rebuilt by NOMI, the NOMI Dragster isn't at all like it's street legal siblings. Considered one of the best if not THE best dragster of the 1990's, the NOMI Dragster won countless races. Powered by Ibishu's 2.0L I4, and given the NOMI Drag Package, the NOMI Dragster produces an insane 1500 horsepower, making wheelies an easy feat. Only 3 of the original 5 NOMI Dragsters exist, with the other 2 destroyed in crashes. Good luck.",
