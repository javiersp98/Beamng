"Description":"The Type-X was a limited edition 200BX, an experiment by Ibishu to see what interested buyers. Only 10,000 Type-X 200BX's were produced for the trial run. The Type-X was based off of the Type-LS, but added a larger, sportier-looking spoiler, Okudai RZ4 alloy wheels, and some minor engine tweaking.",
