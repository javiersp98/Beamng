"Description":"1988 marked a dark time in Civetta's history, the end of production of the extremely popular Bolide coincided with the death of Civetta's founder, Enzo Civetta. In honor of both the Bolide, and Enzo Civetta, the last Bolides produced were exclusively painted in 'Citrico Arancia' Yellow, and given 'Perfettamente Integrato' decals. Each car was powered by the 412 horsepower 3.9L Race engine from the Group 4 Bolide, and given a more aerodynamic bumper. Only 99 Bolide 'Perettamente Integrato' cars were built, following Enzo Civetta's philosophy; ''You should build one less car than the market demands.''",
