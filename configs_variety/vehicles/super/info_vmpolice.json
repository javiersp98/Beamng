"Description":"Based off of the 350 GT, the 'Polizia' Bolide was produced in small numbers throughout the Bolide's production run. Given the 3.9L Race engine, the 'Polizia' variant was much more powerful than it appeared, and included a high performance radiator, oil cooler, and race brakes. Mostly used as a show of police power, the Polizia Bolide was not used as often as a normal police car, but when it was, it was extremely feared by criminals, and respected by many.",
