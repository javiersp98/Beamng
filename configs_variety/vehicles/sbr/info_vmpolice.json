"Description":"Hirochi unvailed the SBR4 TT S AWD Police hoping to appeal to police department in need of high speed pursuit units. While police departments mostly used the SBR4 TT S AWD Police for public safety programs, and school programs, occasionally they were put to use in high speed pursuits. The stage one twin turbocharged 2.5L F4 delivers 350 horsepower, making sure any speedy criminals are still within the reach of the law.",
