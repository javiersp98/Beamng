"Description":"When Hirochi announced the SBR4, Japanese tuner Nomi was anticipated by the public to release a monster of a car. The Hirochi NOMI 500R was the answer. Powered by a tuned stage 2 twin turbocharged 2.5L F4, the 500R was extremely fast, and was modified by Nomi to have RWD, with Folk ET73 wheels, and large brakes. Only 250 500Rs were built, each one came with a plaque showing which number it was, and all Nomi 500R owners were offered two days of advanced driving instruction at Hirochi Raceway.",
