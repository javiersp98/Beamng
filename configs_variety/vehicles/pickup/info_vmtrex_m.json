"Description":"A legend among the off-road community, only 5,000 'T-REX' D15s were built, all under the watchful eye of Gavril Racing. Massive Trial 1000 wheels were fitted to highly tuned off-road suspension, off-road fender flares were added, a bull bar was welded to the frame, and an off-road bumper was attached to the rear. A bumper lip and bed cover were added for aesthetics. Powered by a highly tuned, supercharged Gavril V8, cooled by a high performance radiator, the 'T-REX' was built to handle any and all terrain, and look cool while doing it. The custom paint job was exclusive to the 'T-REX,' making them stand out among the crowd.",
